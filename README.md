# ImpedanceMatching
UI for for the matchbox with L-geometry
- This is a UI where one can change capacity and coil values and see how the response is. It is about the matching of impedance from the RF generator with 50Ohm impedance to the Load. This cann be used in the plasma chamber.
- ImpedanceMatchingUI.py is a triger file to start the ui.
